# angularAllTopics

In this git.
I am trying to keep regular Angular concepts.
The main branch is develop which I am doing periodically merge.
The purpose of git is to include more angular concept in one branch, I haven't took care of UI layout much in this git. 

In entire flow all the components are lazy loaded

shortcut command for lazy loading

ng generate module <NewcomponentName> --module <ParentRouteComponentName> --routing true --route <routewhichyouwanakeep> 
  
  example
  
  ng generate module interaction-using-observable --module componentinteraction --routing true --route interactionobservableexample
